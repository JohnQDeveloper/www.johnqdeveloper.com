### Basic details

* I suffer from depression and am prone to psychotic episodes when I fail to get enough sleep due to insomnia. With the right drugs, this results in a normal life beyond the difficulty with having the time to do things (keeping someone medicated to sleep leads to low energy/metabolism during the day as the stuff isn't an instant on/off with psychiatric drugs) and a lack of desire to go out among people because I'm sometimes not 100% free of the paranoia that came with the episodes. I also have bouts of irritability that I am not sure is really related since they seem to happen mostly under stress and I suspect that is more a normal behavior among people when stress/lack of sleep makes them easily irritated with people.

* I have typical "office worker + antidepressants + antipsychotics" issues with weight gain, diabetes, and so forth. Exercise is not a practical solution due to the hours required to counteract the medication my life would be exercise/work/essential functions/sleep. An hour at the gym every day is not going to result in any weight loss (i.e. I tried a for 8-12 months and 3 times and I GAINED weight). I tried multiple times, including personal trainers. It is basically calorie restriction is required on the carbs/sugar axis in combination with weight loss drugs. I still go for walks and such, just I'm not trying to push myself to lose weight through expecise at the expense of a life. I should have gone into construction if I wanted to do it naturally. lol. Just because exercise has greatly reduced effect doesn't mean 8 hours wouldn't make a difference. I just don't have that kind of time with an office job.

* It should be noted that "psychotic patients" are not considered criminally insane/asylum types. They are simply people who are somewhat functional between episodes and need intense care as well as monitoring during an episode to avoid hurting themselves (or other people). With proper handling, psychotic patients with an episode are going to live and not hurt anyone. The problem is the only safe environment for me and society is in a psychiatric wing during a full blown episode. It should be noted ever since I had a stable supply of antipsychotics for emergencies, I've never had one of those. The risk never goes away since if the voices at the start of an episode manage to convince me not to take the medication...yeah. Bad times for all involved really.
