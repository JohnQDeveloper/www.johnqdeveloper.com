_Should not be updated more often than once every 2-3 years_

### Main Goals
1) Be Happy
2) Stay on target for a 2040 / Age 56 retirement date. (~$75k/year in passive income in 2025 USD)
3) Write that LitRPG Novel that I never seem to finish
4) Build out that Nation Grand Strategy Roleplay game I never seem to get where I want in actual play
5) Share my personal code / infrastructure / etc with the world in the hopes my experience and choices are useful to someone.
6) Maintain my health where it is beyond a bit of weight loss and less insomnia/naps.
7) Write that LITRPG I've never gotten around to.
8) Build some sort of side project income that is meaningful (i.e. 5 figures a year) to my bottom line.
